Given two baseball teams players salaries - We are tasked first with creating a model to predict player salary.

The Rmarkdown file covers all steps involved starting from data entry, cleanup, validating. Exploratory data analysis with boxplots and scatter plots. Feature selection and detection of multicollinearity. 

Task two involved predicting the likelyhood of a hit - Again we explore the data graphically and use logistic regression to creade a probability. The accuracy of the model is improved upon by 10% by using a Decision Tree model.
